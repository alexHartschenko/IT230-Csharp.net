1.) Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the application you developed. What user needs was this application designed to address?
      Both parts starting with any debugging of provided code. Both parts were of a program for students to register for classes. Part I is for console and part II had GUI elements (WPF). Part II asked for code to be added to handle the button click. This application was designed to address the user need to be able to register for the right amount of classes successfully.
      
2.) What did you do particularly well in developing this application?
      I feel I did particauarly well at debugging the initial code. I like puzzles and this was a great way for me to test my knowledge of C#.
      
3.) Compare and contrast the Console and WPF application designs. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
      Both programs were similar and successful in design. They both had a way of presenting the user with a list of available courses, a way for the user to register for courses, and for a way to see the courses registered to. All those supported the user needs. The WPF application had more GUI elements and would be easier to use because of that, versus a simple console program. 

4.) How did you approach the process of debugging and coding your application? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could you use those techniques or strategies in the future?
      Both parts I started by debugging the given code. I would start at the top, and work my way down. I looked for common errors, like forgetting a semicolon or a parethasis or using the wrong oporator or comparison. It can be smart to look for common mistakes first before getting into the thick of it and looking for more complex errors in logic. 

5.) Where did you have to be innovative to overcome a challenge in the full application development process?
      In Part II, I struggled to find the correct way to access "label3" to display the success or fail messages to the user. At the time, I did not know it was called "label3". I searched deep inside existing code in the MainWindow xaml to find it and what it's variables are. I then compared those to existing code on how to access those to do what I need. The similar concept applies to the code I needed to change the color of those messages too. This part was not required, but I felt the change was necessary to inprove the UI and UX.
